README for our website template:
we should probably start by making some short term goals so we can break this down into something we can actually understand.
Now that the readme and github are initialized I'll probably start watching some youtube and using chatgpt to familizarize myself with how any of this works. We should probably document anything interesting or important in this readme.

Deploying website:
Github pages sources from the gh-pages branch (currently only uses the index.html file). Unsure how it all works but any changes to the gh-pages branch should be automatically built when pushed. Planning on protecting the branch..

This is a second test
